            <p class="introduction"> <strong>Hey there, it's Jey!</strong><br>Or Jeylin. Or Jeyleen. Or Ceylin. Honestly, given the variety of ways to spell my name, I stick with Jey for simplicity's sake.  Based in Lausanne, I am a final year student at EHL (hopefully) gradutating in July 2024. I am originally from Azerbaijan, but I moved quite a bit during my childhood which explains my interest for discovering different cultures and languages. I am passionate about tech, finance, and the music industry. In my free time, I play with my band and give literature&philosphy tutorings to UK students. </p>
